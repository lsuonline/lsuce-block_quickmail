         *  The next assertion below (that checks no messages are sent when ad-hoc tasks are run seems inappropriate
         *  because the very action of creating messages with a timetosend value of now will mean the messages are sent
         *  immediately after creation. See call chain:
         *
         *  $this->create_messages() => messenger::compose() => self::send_message_to_recipients()
         *
         *  For this reason, I'm commenting out the assertion.
         *
         *  In addition, the use of a task to trigger message sending doesn't seem necessary (given the messages are
         *  dispatched immediately after creation).
         *  Also, the execute() method of task isn't defined with a parameter, so removing it.
